                      <li>Hydrogenated oils</li>

                      The toxins inside of us have a way of controlling us.  As we start do to things to purge them, they will try to  sabotage our progress.  We need to establish some tools to help us stay the course.  Journaling, prayer and meditation will allow us to combat not only the physical toxins, but the emotional ones that have been stored for years as well.  We can write our thoughts, feelings, frustrations, joys.  We can pray for strength and guidance, we can meditate on the things that we would like to manifest.  During this journey, we will have to find the peace inside of the storm.  We will have to find comfort when we are uncomfortable.  Let's identify our weapons so that we can fight fire with fire!!

                        <p>The truth is, what we put into our bodies is only half the battle.  The other half is... what comes out.  During this cleanse, we are pulling toxins out of hiding and reintroducing them back into our system at an insane rate, and if our bodies cannot purge them quickly enough, they will get reabsorbed.    Colonics and enemas are an excellent way to purge pounds of toxins quickly.</p>
                        
                        <p>Colonics and enemas both involve introducing water into the colon through to rectum in order to cleanse the colon. The major difference is that colonics cleanse the entire length of the colon while enemas cleanse the lower part of the colon.</p>

                        <p>A colonic can clean out years of impacted waste from your colon, and the enemas will clean out the most recent waste, but more important, the enemas will help alleviate some of the detox symptoms that you may get throughout the cleanse. So, when you start to feel the flu-like symptomsÂ or get dizzy or lightheaded, or if you are just feeling tired and out of it (all signs that your body is trying to get rid of stored toxins), do the enema, drink lots of water and go to sleep. You should wake up feeling much better.</p>
                        
                        <p>I recommend that people get a colonic during the first week of the cleanse. Once you get your first colonic, your colon therapist will counsel you on whether or not you need more. Sometimes they will recommend that you do a series of at least 3 to allow for a deeper cleanse.</p>

                      Nuts are an important ally, especially in a plant-based diet.  So, why CAN'T we have then during this cleanse?  Think about this, when nuts are processed, they get extremely sticky.  Have you ever tried to wash peanut butter off of a spoon?  Well, this happens when we chew nuts also.  The become extremely sticky inside of our digestive tract, and are more difficult to eliminate. Since we want to clear out our colons during thing cleanse, we want to avoid things that will make that more difficult.  For this reason, we want to avoid Nuts during for the next few weeks!

This includes white rice, white pasta, white sugar, white bread, most commercially available cereals etc. Because the fiber has been removed it enters your bloodstream quickly, spikes your blood sugar and leaves you feeling depleted soon after.</p>

The only foods that are whole grains are actually whole grains.

                      <p> Weeks 1 and 3 are not nearly as difficult to do as it has been in the past. Â There are several restaurants that offer vegan/whole food as well as live food. Â 
Ethnic restaurants such as Thai, Indian, and Mexican are great places for days 1, 2, 20 and 21. Â 
Live food restaurants are popping up all over the place. Â Search the area that you are traveling to to see what they have to offer. Â Foods like guacamole, and pico de gallo are always raw. Â Salads are a great option, ask for oil and vinegar or fresh lemon to squeeze on top. Â Some mainstream restaurants also offer raw dishes, check out the Cheesecake factory and their thai lettuce wraps (substitute avocado for the chicken)!
Whole Foods Market, Earthfare, Food Coops or other natural food stores are also a great place to look</p>

 <p>Week 2 you will only be consuming liquids, but even that has gotten easier:
raw juices are now available in stores. Â They are "cold pressed". Â Brands like Evolution, Blueprint, and Suja are 100% raw and you can have them during the cleanse. Â Just make sure it is juice and not a smoothie.Â 
scout out some juice bars near where you will be traveling and along the route.Â  Many airports now have some type of âfresh fruit standâ where they may serve fresh juice. Â It mayÂ  only be fresh orange juice, but that is fine!
Herbal teas, kombucha and Miso soups can be found on the go!
Purchase some green powder blends like wheatgrass or spirulina (which should be able to pass through airport security), then , purchase the highest quality juice you can find, and mix them together.</p>

 <p>Hopefully one of these ideas will work but if you still donât think that you can manage, depending on the length of your trip, you can try shifting the days a bit to start juicing earlier and end earlier, or start juicing later and end laterâ¦</p>

                        <li>Our bodies are detoxing, so we may experience headaches, flu-like symptoms, nausea, irritability.. It is OK.</li>
                        <li>Our digestive system may act up. We may experience gas, bloating, constipation, or many bowel movements. It is OK.</li>
                        <li>We may get frustrated because your grocery bill may be a little (or a lot) higher than normal... It is OK (better to spend $$ up front on quality foods than at the end on dr. bills)</li>
                        <li>We may have skin breakouts, discharge, coated tongues, funny smells... It is OK</li>
                        <li>We may be very emotional, crying for no apparent reason, or extremely happy. The thing with this is that foods lock in all of the emotions that we are feeling while we are eating. And when the toxins in that food get locked and stored away, so do those emotions (this is why you should not eat during emotional times, you should fast through them). When we detox, those toxins are released with guess what... so are those emotions. Whatever we felt when our first love broke up with you in the 12th grade and we pigged out junk... That is going to come back out again, and we may find ourselves soaking in a salt bath just crying... We are not crazy... It is OK.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                
                      <p>All of these things are a normal part of detox. These are signs that our body is fighting a valiant fight for us!</p>
                      <p>Generally speaking, fruits are cleansing foods which help the body detox more quickly.   Their high water content flushes your digestive tract, our kidneys and purifies the bloodstream.  If we start to have severe detox symptoms, we should cut down on the amount of fruit juice we are drinking and incorporate more vegetable juices.</p>
                      <p>During this phase, we may experience more intense detox symptoms, especially for the first 3 days (headaches, stomach aches, lack of energy, irritability, highly emotional (sadness, happiness, anger, frustration...), flu-like symptoms, acne, discharge, body odor...). Fortunately, these 3 days are over the weekend, so, if needed,  we can treat this detox like a snow day... stay in bed, get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids.  </p>
                      <p>In a few days, you should be over the majority of the symptoms, and we will start to experience a resurgence of energy.</p>

                      <p>This is the most popular question around :-)</p>
â
 <p>No, but you can try some alternatives!</p>
 <p>There are a couple of reasons why people prefer coffee as their morning beverage:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>is the caffeine to help get them going</li>
  <li>is the strong robust taste</li>
  <li>is the comfort of a warm drink</li>
</ul>

 <p>So my substitutes are:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Peppermint tea.Â  peppermint is a natural stimulant, although more subtle than caffeine.</li>
  <li>Dandelion tea, it has a roasted kind of flavor (not like coffee, but still satisfying), and it helps break addictions</li>
  <li>Lemon ginger tea (with fresh lemons and ginger), this is a strong taste if you need something strong in the morning.</li>
  <li>Roasted Chicory Root - somehow is used in coffee substitutes</li>
  <li>check out some recipes</li>
</ul>
â
 <p>If you find that your headaches are unbearable, and make it difficult to function, downgrade to green tea in the morning.Â  it contains lower amounts of caffeine, and it contains antioxidants, so it's a good transition when trying to wean yourself off the coffee. </p>
