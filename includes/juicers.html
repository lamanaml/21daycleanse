   <div class="header">Choosing a Juicer</div>

   <p class="card-text">  During the liquid phase, we will need a juicer. Make sure to purchase a juicer not a blender.</p>

   <p class="card-text">A juicer separates the fiber from the rest of the fruit or vegetables. This leaves only the juice for you to drink. … A blender processes the whole fruit or vegetable, including the fiber. This makes a thicker drink (usually called a smoothie). Smoothies are excellent to drink, but during a detox, they will keep our digestive systems running, slowing down the detox, and will cause us to feel prolonged hunger.</p>

   <p class="card-text">There are 3 different types of juicers, Centrifugal, Masticating, and Twin Gear. Check out his excellent article that explains each one. Side note: along with these are juice presses (like Norwalk – which are thousands of dollars, and citrus juicer with are extremely inexpensive yet useful).</p>

One issue I have, when juicing Kale with the Hamilton Beach juicer; I have to ensure the stems in the middle are chopped very small. If not it clogs the juicer.</td>
