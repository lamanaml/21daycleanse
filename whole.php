          <h3 >What are Whole Foods?</h3>
        
        <p class="card-text">Whole foods are unprocessed, or minimally processed, fruits, veggies, whole grains and beans.  This means that they are as close to nature as can be. A good rule of thumb to figure out if something is a whole food or not is to try to identify where it come from.  For example, corn is grown from a crop... thus being a whole food.  On the other hand, corn chips... hmmm, well.. you get my point, right?   </p>
         <p class="card-text"> Our bodies are designed to process food from it's whole natural state.  We can extract the nutrients, and dispose of it very efficiently.  
            Since processed foods have already been "processed", meaning that much of the fiber and nutrition has been removed, our bodies are able not to extract much, and without the fiber, is not able to dispose of it as efficiently.  Our bodies are more likely to store processed foods as toxins.  These toxins will be covered with a layer of a mucus for protection until it can figure out how to get rid of it.</p>
        <p class="card-text">During the whole food phase (days 1, 2, 20 and 21), we will enjoy cooked and raw whole foods! Because these foods are unprocessed, our digestive systems will be able to process them more efficiently, and extract the nutrients that we need. </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            OK, that is the first phase in a nutshell.  We should have a good understanding of what we can and cannot eat.  Now, let's take to the internet (or cookbooks) and find our own breakfast and lunch/dinner recipes! Try to find at least 2 good recipes!  Remember, the recipe is only a guide, not the law.  We can swap out ingredients, omit or add items to suit our needs.  This exercise will help inspire our own creativity.</p> 
         <p class="card-text">Once we find them,  <a href="http://culinaryhealing21days.com/notes/"> let's share them in the daily discussion! </a> </p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Building a Menu</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
          Now that we have some recipes under our belt, let's build a menu.  We can get as simple or as fancy as we like, but Let's keep this part manageable.  Let's keep this part realistic...keeping in mind our time and skills.  Try to find meals with repeating ingredients, this will help reduce grocery cost and waste.  Also, don't be afraid to substitute ingredients!</p>
          <p class="card-text">
          Then use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC1dWrGP80H9j25vTLd2Q4wh21h8-jic8fuFtWKJB7I/edit?usp=sharing">menu planner</a> to help keep track of your thoughts. </p>

          <p class="card-text">
          Let's put our knowledge into action.  Next, we will build a grocery list then go shopping!.  
          At the store, shop mostly the outside perimeter of the grocery store (where the produce is - avoiding the processed food. ) and read labels, and have fun! </p>
