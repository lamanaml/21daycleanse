      <h3 >What are Liquids?</h3>
       <p class="card-text">        
        During this phase (days 7-14) we will consume fresh nutrient-dense fruit and vegetable juices, herbal teas and water! While water alone may leave us feeling drained, freshly pressed juices will give us an energy surge. The nutrients in the juice will be absorbed by all the cells in our bodies, allowing them to immediately repair and restore our bodies at the cellular level. 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Liquids mean that no fiber is present.  Removing fiber allows our digestive systems slow down enough to start to reintroduce the stored toxins back into our bloodstream so they can be eliminated.  This, my friends, is called detoxing.  This is where the magic happens. </p> 

        <p class="card-text">The key to the liquids phase is to avoid all fiber.  If we keep to strictly juice with no cheating, within 3 days our hunger should subside along with the detox symptoms.  </p>
        <p class="card-text"> 
          That said, for this phase, you will need a juicer.  To get the juice from fruits and veggies, we must use a JUICER, not a BLENDER.  A blender will mix the liquid with the fiber, while a juicer will extract the liquid, separating it from the fiber.  </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Cleaning  fruits and veggies</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> Fill your sink with cold water, add 4 tablespoons of salt and the juice of a lemon. Soak the fruits and veggies for 10 minutes then rinse under cold water. 1/4 cup of vinegar can be substituted for lemon.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Storing your Juice</h5>
      <p class="card-text">We drink fresh fruit and veggie juice because it still has all its nutrients and enzymes. This means that the juice still has it's "life force". This life force is what will give you energy throughout the cleanse. Fresh juice begins to lose its nutrients immediately, therefore it's best to drink fresh juice right away. </p>
    
      <p class="card-text">
      The tips that follow will save you time in the kitchen by showing you how to store juices and keep as much of the life force intact as possible.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">Try to avoid contact with light, heat, and air as they will cause juice to oxidize (losing its life force)
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Keep the juice as cold as possible. If you have to store the juice for a while, make sure that the container is airtight and refrigerated.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Fill the juice all the way to the top to help reduce the amount of air that gets in.
        </li>

          <h3 class="card-title">Recipe Scavenger Hunt</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
         After we fully understand the criteria for liquids, let's take to the internet (or cookbooks) and find our own recipes! Try to find at least 2 good recipes!  Since juice contains higher concentrations of vitamins and minerals, it can be a great alternative to supplements.  If you are lacking in vitamins, find fruits and veggies high in that nutrient and add it to your juice!   Remember, the recipe is only a guide, not the law.  We can swap out ingredients, omit or add items to suit our needs.  This exercise will help inspire our own creativity.</p> 
         <p class="card-text">Once we find them,  <a href="http://culinaryhealing21days.com/notes/"> let's share them in the daily discussion</a>!    Ready, set, gooo! </p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Building a Menu</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
          Now that we have some recipes under our belt, let's build a menu.  We can get as simple or as fancy as we like, but Let's keep this part manageable.  Think realistically about what you can/will make for each meal.   Try to find meals with repeating ingredients, this will help reduce grocery cost and waste.  Also, don't be afraid to substitute ingredients!</p>
          <p class="card-text">
          Then use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC1dWrGP80H9j25vTLd2Q4wh21h8-jic8fuFtWKJB7I/edit?usp=sharing">menu planner</a> to help keep track of your thoughts. </p>

          <p class="card-text">
          Let's put our knowledge into action.  Next, we will build a grocery list then go shopping!.  
          At the store, shop mostly the outside perimeter of the grocery store (where the produce is - avoiding the processed food. ) and read labels, and have fun! </p>
